## Coding Challenge (option 1)
•	Using a publicly available API (e.g. Alpha Vantage, Finnhub Stock API) or your own mocked out repository, retrieve last weeks’ worth of historical share price data for a user supplied company (e.g. BPP, VOD). 
•	Display the stock name and minimum, maximum and average share price over the week (console or basic template).
•	Allow the user to export this as a JSON file.
